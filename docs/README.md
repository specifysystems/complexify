# Lifemapper and Specify Network

KUBI virtual environment containing several branded access points to tools for the
Biodiversity Informatics Community.

Access will be via APIs and other services (eg mapping services).  In some cases a web
application will provide an interactive web-based user interface.  Clients, such as a
python library will be written to simplify programmatic access to the services.

Access points are described in [frontends](frontends.md), and the tools and infrastructure that
powers them are described in [toolbox](toolbox.md).
